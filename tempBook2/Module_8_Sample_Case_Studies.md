## 🌿 Case Study 4 — Environment: Reverse Prompt Engineering Lab

**File:**

- environment/water_quality.csv

### Purpose
This case study teaches **Reverse Prompt Engineering**, a key technique to analyze and understand how prompts work.  
Students will analyze a short pre‑generated AI environmental report, infer the likely prompt behind it, test their reconstruction, and refine it.  
The focus is on **understanding how prompts shape outputs**.

### Learning Goal
Develop skills in:
- analyzing LLM outputs for structural and contextual clues  
- reconstructing implicit prompt components  
- testing and improving prompts  
- understanding how to use meta-prompt to reverse prompting 

### Step 1 — Prompt Output

```
Across the monitoring period, average chlorophyll-a levels varied substantially by site,
with Lake C showing the highest mean concentration (≈20.4 µg/L)—a level consistent with moderate ecological risk.
River B, by contrast, averaged ≈11.3 µg/L and River A remained lowest at ≈7.7 µg/L.
Additionally, a simple 3-week rolling trend analysis indicates a recent upward chlorophyll-a tendency (≈13.9 µg/L) across the dataset,
suggesting that nutrient or temperature conditions may be becoming more favorable for algal activity and warrant continued monitoring.
```

### Step 2 — Prompt/Context Engineering Analysis

Identify what the model seems to have assumed:
- **Role** (e.g., environmental analyst)
- **Instruction** (e.g., identify anomalies, summarize risks)
- **Context** (e.g., multi‑site water quality dataset)
- **Constraints** (e.g., concise summary, structured findings)
- **Output Format** (e.g., paragraphs, sections, recommendations)
- **Tone** (e.g., scientific, cautious, formal)

Record your observations.

### Step 3 — Reconstruct the Prompt

Using the structure presented above, reconstruct the prompt.
Your reconstruction should be explicit and testable.

### Step 4 — Test the Reconstructed Prompt

Upload to the LLM (file in the ZIP):
- environment/water_quality.csv

Run your reconstructed prompt and compare the generated output to the original prompt output presented in Step 1.

```
System role:
Instruction:
Context:
Constraints:
Output Format:
Tone: 
```

Questions to analyze:
- What parts match closely?
- What is missing or added?
- What does the model misinterpret or hallucinate?

### Step 5 — Refine the Prompt

Improve accuracy by adding:
- domain‑specific terminology  
- clearer instructions  
- explicit data references  
- uncertainty/safety statements  
- required sections (e.g., “Risk Indicators,” “Recommended Actions”)  
- stylistic constraints  

### Step 6 — Reverse-Prompting

```
Here is an AI-generated output for the attached file:

Across the monitoring period, average chlorophyll-a levels varied substantially by site,
with Lake C showing the highest mean concentration (≈20.4 µg/L)—a level consistent with moderate ecological risk.
River B, by contrast, averaged ≈11.3 µg/L and River A remained lowest at ≈7.7 µg/L.
Additionally, a simple 3-week rolling trend analysis indicates a recent upward chlorophyll-a tendency (≈13.9 µg/L) across the dataset,
suggesting that nutrient or temperature conditions may be becoming more favorable for algal activity and warrant continued monitoring.

Your task is to reverse prompt this output.
That means: propose one or more possible prompts that could have generated it.
Explain your reasoning and show how different phrasings might affect the response.
```

Compare you refined prompt with the reversed prompt generated by the model.

### Reflection

> 1. Which components of the prompt reconstruction were most influential in shaping the output?  
> 2. How does your engineered prompt compare with the model reverse prompt?  

## 🎨 Case Study 5 — Arts: Meta-Prompting for Creative Tasks

**File:**

- arts/story_seeds.csv

### Purpose
You will learn how to ask the model to **generate a high-quality prompt** tailored to your creative goals.  
Similar to the previous case study, but with a different purpose, this develops the skill of *meta-prompting*, where the LLM designs the prompt you should use for the task.

### Learning Goal
Apply the principles of **meta-prompting**, **prompt evaluation**, and **prompt refinement** to generate a better creative-writing prompt than you might write manually.

### Step 1 — Choose a Story Seed

Choose a row from file arts/story_seeds.csv. 

### Step 2 — Ask the Model to Create a Prompt for You

Use this meta-prompt:

```
Create a high-quality creative-writing prompt based on the following story seed.

Seed: [enter the story seed]

Your prompt must:

1. Assign a role to the model.
2. Define a clear writing task.
3. Use the seed as explicit context.
4. Specify tone, style, mood, and pacing constraints.
5. Require a structured output format (e.g., setting, conflict, turning point, resolution).
6. Include a length target (e.g., ~150 words).
7. Add constraints that improve narrative clarity and emotional depth.
```

### Step 3 — Evaluate the AI-Generated Prompt

Ask the model:

```
Evaluate this prompt using criteria such as relevance, completeness, clarity, factual accuracy, and format.
Suggest improvements.
```

(Optional) Request a rubric:

```
Generate a rubric (criteria + descriptions) for evaluating creative-writing prompts.
```

### Step 4 — Refine the Prompt

Use a prompt like:

```
Rewrite this prompt to maximize narrative clarity, improve constraints, 
tighten tone/style guidance, and require a stronger turning point.
```

Your refined prompt becomes the “Scene B”.

### Step 5 — Generate Scenes Using Both Prompts

- **Scene A** → created using the *model-generated prompt*  
- **Scene B** → created using *your refined prompt*

Then compare the results:

```
Compare Scene A and Scene B.
Which prompt produced stronger storytelling, clearer structure, and richer sensory detail? Why?
```

### Reflection

> 1. What features made the AI-generated prompt effective or ineffective?  
> 2. Why is meta-prompting a powerful professional skill?  

## Submission & Reflection

- Submit your **prompts**, **AI outputs**, and a **short reflection (150–200 words)** for one or more case studies.
- Discuss how **prompt and context** shaped your results, and where **human judgment** was most critical.

## Reflection

> 1. Which of these case studies feels most relevant to your field or future career?  
> 2. How might you apply similar principles in your own work or research?  
> 3. What challenges or safeguards would you need to ensure responsible AI use?

Reflect on how the lessons from these cases — transparency, context, and collaboration — can guide your personal or organizational approach to AI adoption.
