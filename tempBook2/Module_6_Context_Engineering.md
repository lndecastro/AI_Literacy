# Module 6 - Context Engineering: Advanced AI Communication

Context engineering is the practice of **designing, structuring, and managing the broader environment** in which a large language model (LLM) processes information, not just the direct prompt.
While prompt engineering focuses on *how you phrase the instruction*, context engineering focuses on *what additional information surrounds and informs that instruction*.
It is sometimes called *“prompt engineering on steroids”* because it moves beyond single instructions into **systematic control of the model’s cognitive environment**.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define **Context Engineering** and explain its importance in guiding AI behavior and output quality.  
- Identify key components that shape AI context, including **role**, **audience**, **purpose**, **tone**, and **constraints**.  
- Design prompts that embed clear contextual cues to improve relevance, coherence, and ethical alignment.  
- Distinguish between **explicit** and **implicit** context in human–AI interaction.  
- Apply context engineering techniques to achieve desired outcomes across different domains and use cases.  
- Reflect on how context influences meaning, interpretation, and responsibility in AI-generated content.  

## 6.1 Why Context Matters?

LLMs generate answers based purely on the **input context window**: the prompt plus any surrounding data you provide. By carefully shaping this context, you can:
- **Bias the model toward desired outcomes**  
- **Reduce hallucination** by grounding responses in authoritative sources  
- **Adapt the model to specific roles**  
- **Create repeatable workflows** for consistency  

## 6.2 Key Techniques in Context Engineering

Context engineering integrates multiple techniques to shape how AI systems interpret inputs, maintain coherence, and generate relevant, high-quality outputs. Each technique contributes to a structured interaction framework that transforms a simple prompt into a rich, goal-oriented exchange.

1. **System Role Design** – Define the AI’s persona or purpose.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   You are an experienced data storyteller helping a university explain research findings to a general audience. Use clear, engaging language and avoid technical jargon.
   ```

2. **Instruction Layering** – Combine multiple prompt patterns (e.g., role + format + goal).  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Act as a policy analyst. Summarize this report in bullet points, then draft a 100-word executive summary emphasizing environmental impact.
   ```

3. **Contextual Priming** – Provide reference materials or examples to shape the model’s reasoning.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Here is an example of a strong abstract for a research paper. Use the same structure and tone to rewrite the following abstract.
   ```

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Dynamically inject external data into the prompt to enhance factual grounding.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Using the following retrieved text from a 2024 WHO report, summarize the three main health challenges related to AI in diagnostics.
   (Paste retrieved content or database snippet below.)
   ```

5. **Chained Prompts** – Break complex tasks into sequential, interdependent stages.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Step 1: List key challenges in AI ethics in higher education.
   Step 2: For each challenge, propose one institutional policy response.
   Step 3: Summarize the recommendations in a 150-word brief.
   ```

6. **Output Shaping** – Specify the desired tone, style, or format of the response.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Write the introduction as if for a university newsletter — friendly, professional, and limited to 120 words.
   ```

7. **Negative Context Engineering** – Explicitly define what should be avoided or excluded.  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Summarize the benefits of generative AI in healthcare, but do not include examples related to patient data privacy or regulation.
   ```

8. **Multi-Modal Context Orchestration** – Combine multiple input types (e.g., text, image, or structured data).  
   *Example:*  
   ```
   Analyze the chart below showing AI model accuracy over time and write a paragraph explaining the trend. Reference the image in your response.
   (Insert chart or figure here.)
   ```

## 6.3 Prompt vs Context Engineering

| Aspect        | Prompt Engineering              | Context Engineering                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Focus         | Wording of instruction          | Full environment around the instruction         |
| Scope         | Single prompt                   | Multi-layered input, documents, workflows       |
| Goal          | Better single response          | Consistent, domain-specific high-quality outputs|
| Analogy       | Writing a recipe                | Designing the entire kitchen and pantry setup   |

## 6.4 Example in Education and Learning

**Prompt Engineering Example:**  
```
Summarize this lesson plan in three bullet points.
```

**Context Engineering Example:**  
```
System Role: You are an instructional designer specializing in technology-enhanced learning.

Reference Context: Here are three sample lesson plans from previous AI Literacy workshops [INSERT OR UPLOAD CONTENT].

Task: Evaluate the following lesson plan. Compare it to the reference cases and summarize in three bullet points.

Output: Provide a structured table with Strengths, Weaknesses, and Improvement Suggestions.
```

By embedding **role, reference materials, task, and output format**, the model produces more reliable and actionable results.

## 6.5 Example in Healthcare

**Prompt Engineering Example:** 
```
Summarize this patient case in three bullet points.
```

**Context Engineering Example:**  
```
System Role: You are a clinical data analyst supporting a hospital’s quality-improvement team.

Reference Context and Task: Review the following anonymized patient summary and compare it to current treatment guidelines provided in the reference file.

Output: Present your response in three bullet points organized under: Key Findings, Potential Risks, and Recommended Next Steps.
```

This demonstrates how adding context transforms a basic summarization task into a guided, responsible, and domain-specific analysis—producing output aligned with medical standards and professional use.

## Exercise 1: From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

**Part A – Prompt Engineering (Baseline)**  
Use a simple prompt to complete the task below:
```
Summarize the following startup idea in three bullet points:

Startup Idea: An AI-powered platform that helps local farmers predict crop diseases using satellite images and weather data.
```

**Part B – Context Engineering (Enhanced)**  
Expand the same task into a **context-engineered input** by adding:  
1. **System Role**  
2. **Reference Material**  
3. **Instruction Layering**  
4. **Output Shaping**  

*Example:*  
```
System Role: You are a venture capital analyst specializing in AgriTech startups.

Reference Context: Farmers face billions in losses annually due to crop diseases. Satellite-based solutions are an emerging trend in precision agriculture.

Task: Summarize the following startup idea. Compare it to typical AgriTech innovations and highlight market potential.

Startup Idea: An AI-powered platform that helps local farmers predict crop diseases using satellite images and weather data.

Output: Provide three bullet points under the headings:
- Value Proposition
- Market Fit
- Investment Potential
```

**Your Task:**  
1. Write your own **context-engineered version** of the baseline prompt.  
2. Compare the two outputs (baseline vs. context-engineered).  
3. Reflect: *What improvements did context engineering bring to the AI’s response?*

## 6.6 Personalized Assistants and Projects: Extending the GenAI Toolkit

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Claude provide powerful **general-purpose intelligence**, but professionals often need **domain-specific capabilities**.
